- **First Impression Impact**: "Height halo effect" influences initial judgments
- **Economic Advantage**: Taller individuals earn 2-3% more per inch of height

#### 🎯 Applied to Presidential Politics

**The "Presidential Look" Phenomenon:**
- **Voter Psychology**: Unconscious preferences for certain physical traits
- **Debate Dynamics**: Taller candidates appear more "commanding"
- **Media Framing**: Height becomes part of "presidential package"
- **Campaign Strategy**: Political consultants consider physical presence

#### 🏛️ Historical Context

**Cultural Foundations:**
- **Ancient Rulers**: Physical stature emphasized in leadership
- **Military Tradition**: Height valued in command structures
- **American Frontier**: Physical presence associated with strength
- **Nobility Association**: Height linked to power and authority

### 🎯 Answer to Research Question 3

**SIGNIFICANT** - Height plays a substantial role in electoral success through unconscious voter bias, media framing, and cultural associations with leadership.
